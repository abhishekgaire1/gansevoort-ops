-- Fixes a real bug in 20260811100079, caught by running the new focused
-- RPC tests against the real DEV database immediately after applying it.
--
-- record_inventory_withdrawal_batch's own RETURNS TABLE includes columns
-- named out_inventory_item_id/out_source_location_id/etc -- since this is
-- a plpgsql function, those column names are ALSO exposed as implicit
-- variables inside its body (standard Postgres behavior for named OUT
-- parameters). Three places called normalize_withdrawal_batch_cart_lines(...)
-- and referenced its identically-named output columns (out_inventory_item_id,
-- out_source_location_id, ...) WITHOUT qualifying them with a table alias:
-- the batch-idempotency EXISTS/EXCEPT comparison (twice), and the movement-
-- header insert's distinct-source-location subquery. Postgres cannot tell
-- whether a bare `out_source_location_id` means the enclosing function's
-- own variable or the table function's column, and fails every such
-- statement with "column reference is ambiguous" -- which, since the
-- movement-header insert is step 7 of every non-replay call, meant every
-- fresh batch submission failed outright, not just idempotency replays.
--
-- Fix: every call to normalize_withdrawal_batch_cart_lines(...) is now
-- aliased and every one of its output columns is referenced through that
-- alias, exactly like the (already-correct) validation/lock/line-insert
-- steps already did.
